  <h4><u>Description</u></h4>
  Tangy, zesty, <del>sun-dried</del> <em>dehydrated</em> tomatoes go well with just about anything. They take a while to cook but are well worth the wait!

  <h4><u>Ingredients</u></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A bunch of smaller variety tomatoes (eg, bing, cherry, roma)</li>
    <li><em>optional:</em> sea salt</li>
    <li><em>optional:</em> green herbs (eg, basil, oregano, etc)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><u>Steps</u></h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 200<span>&#176;</span> F (93<span>&#176;</span> C)</li>
    <li>Get out the largest cooking sheet(s) you own and a mixing bowl</li>
    <li>Slice all tomatoes according to their size:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>For bing, cherry, and other small variety tomatoes: slice in half</li>
      <li>For roma or other medium variety tomatoes: slice into quarters</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Depending on how watery the inside of tomatoes are, discard some of the innards/seeds. This will shorten the cooking time.</li>
    <li><em>Optional: </em> Place sliced tomatoes in mixing bowl. Toss with:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Sea salt</li>
      <li>Green herbs</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Place slices tomatoes on baking sheet(s) skin-side down</li>
    <li>Put baking sheet(s) in oven. Bake on low for...<strong>4-6 hours!</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Obviously, best to prepare these tasty bits when you'll be home for a long stretch of time</li>
      <li><strong>A few words of caution:</strong> As it gets closer to the 4-6 hour mark, check the tomatoes regularly. They will slowly lose their water and shrivel up over the cooking time, but <em>once all their water has evaporated</em> the tomatoes will transition to browning and burning relatively quickly. You just want to make sure to take them out of the oven before that happens!</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Remove from oven and let cool. Tomatoes will keep in air tight container in the refrigerator for ~4-5 days. If you want to store/preserve them for a longer (up to a few weeks), store in a container filled with enough olive oil to cover the tomatoes.</li>

  </ol>
